With over 20 years in the technology space, I bridge the critical gap between **data analytics** and the underlying **IT infrastructure**. My passion is transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive business growth. But unlike many analysts, my perspective is built from the ground upâ€”literally from the server racks to the board room.

My journey began in **operations and systems management**, where I learned firsthand that technology's true value lies in solving tangible business problems. I managed complex inventory systems for Disney vendors, oversaw IT for defense contractors, and honed my skills by implementing **workflow improvements that boosted profitability by 10%**. This experience taught me to think about business needs first.
